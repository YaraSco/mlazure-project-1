# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
This project uses the tabular dataset in the URL "https://automlsamplenotebookdata.blob.core.windows.net/automl-sample-notebook-data/bankmarketing_train.csv". This dataset has 19 attributes for training and the attribute 'y' for predictions. The attribute 'y' has two classes 'no' and 'yes'. It determines if a potentiel client would accept to make a deposit at the bank or decline the offer.

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
The model used by hyperdrive and provided by Scikit-learn, LogisticRegression, had an accuracy of 0.9095. However, the model obtained by an AutoMl run had a better accuracy with 0.9181. So, the best performing model was Voting Ensemble of the Automl run.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
